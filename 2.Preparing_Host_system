installed. Then a partition which will host LFS system is prepared.

2.4. Creating a New Partition

Like most other operating system, LFS is usually on a dedicated partition.
The recommendedapproach to building an LFS system is to use an availabe empty 
partion or, if you have enough unpartitions space, to create one.

2. Swap partition

LFS can use any file system recognized by the linux kernel, but the most common
type are ext3 & ext4.
